## 💁🏽‍♂️ Overview

It's a weather app

## ⚙️ How it works

The app fetches the current weather from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) based on the user location.

It's possible to search for the weather in a specific city too.

The app supports dark and light mode and based on the selected
mode shows a different background image.
